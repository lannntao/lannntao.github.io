I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Deparment of Statistics & Data Science](https://statistics.ucla.edu/) at University of California, Los Angeles(UCLA), where I am advised by [Prof. Guang Cheng](https://faculty.stat.ucla.edu/guangcheng/index.html) at Trustworthy AI Lab. My current research focuses on statistical evaluation of generative data fidelity. I also collaborated with [Prof. Minjeong Jeon](https://sites.google.com/site/arbormj) on developing effect estimations for transition diagnostic classification models. Prior to UCLA, I completed my bachelor's degree of Applied Mathematics at [Tongji University](https://math.tongji.edu.cn/index.htm), advised by Prof. Li Zhang.

Feel free to reach out via email if you are interested in collaborating.

Research Topics
======
My current research topics are on investigating effective methods for evaluating generative data fidelity. Essentially, I am interested in measuring how well a generative model emulates the real data. High fidelity is crucial for ensuring trustworthy outputs in AI applications and maintaining realism in generated content.
