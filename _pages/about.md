I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at [University of California, Los Angeles(UCLA)](https://statistics.ucla.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Guang Cheng](https://faculty.stat.ucla.edu/guangcheng/index.html) at Trustworthy AI Lab. My current research focuses on statistical evaluation of generative data fidelity. I also collaborated with [Prof. Minjeong Jeon](https://sites.google.com/site/arbormj) on developing effect estimations for transition diagnostic classification models. Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree of Applied Mathematics at [Tongji University](https://math.tongji.edu.cn/index.htm), advised by Prof. Li Zhang.
